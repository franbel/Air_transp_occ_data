Using public domain information from the TSB Air transportation occurrence data, a jupyter notebook was used to practice the OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model and Interpret) methodology in Python for Machine Learning. 

Problem definition: can occurrences be predicted? 

What are we looking for: cleaning, exploring, visualizing and modelling relevant features

The notebook includes a set of slides selected for a rise presentation format. 


	- Accidents happening at the same location and fatalities/weekdays
	- Accidents per year and month
	- Fatalities per group (how many accidents produced the most fatalities)
	- Fatalities per operation/aircraft type 
	- Fatalities per make and years
	- Incidents by type

Please provide comments, feedback and build on it to help improving air transportation safety.


Thanks,

Francisco Beltran
