problem definition: can accidents be predicted? 

what are we looking for: cleaning, exploring, visualizing and modelling relevant features

Help needed on graphs (see comments) and fixing the scatter graph ticks to be angled, smaller font to make them easier to the eye, they're taking over the plot itself! Still to go:
- Operator graph (Airline, Private, Govt)
- MakeID (Manufacturer)
- Time of the day

Started classification, issues with object class and slicing, 'too many indexes', need to encode and run RFC

Pending graphs

	- Accidents happening at the same location and fatalities/weekdays
	- Accidents per year and month
	- Fatalities per group (how many accidents produced the most fatalities)
	- Fatalities per operation/aircraft type 
	- Fatalities per make and years
	- Incidents by type

Change OccTypeID from 1,3 to 0,1 and any other columns showing similar
